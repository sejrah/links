Jenkins jobs on master – why not:
Master should only be responsible to run Jenkins, Jenkins related configurations and scheduling jobs for slaves
Configurations related issues (e.g. different jdk versions)
Not scalable

Build can be run on bare metal or in a containerized environment

ECS Plugin
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Amazon+EC2+Container+Service+Plugin

What’s needed:
ECS plugin – allows to run build jobs in AWS ECS cluster
Launch configurations (instance type)
Number of instances
